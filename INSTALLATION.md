# Installation Guide

This is a full guide on how to install Kubuntu for my set up. Feel free to use or copy the whole thing, or just an individual section (see the [license](./license) for the full legal disclamer)). Things may not work perfectly on your machine, so feel free to create an issue or, even better, a pull request with a solution, to make it work for you.

Begin by installing the latest Kubuntu LTS. The current version I'm using is 20.04.
